you make me feel like tearing off my fucking face
anything to get the migraine out from there
you just got back from that other guy's fucking place
and you expect me not to rip out my fucking hair

*lil instrumental section with maybe some people chanting "woahs" or something*

all i ever wanted was to make you feel the way you made me feel
to be able to say that i belonged to you
*tappy shit and then it gets louder*
but the moment you cut me open and looked through my insides
you saw the real...

me

and the world let you down again
i could never be what you expected
can't compare to your other friends
