oh out from home
head out alone
there's one more thing
i'll let you know

don't, don't know what
changed in my heart
i can't explain
it's not the same

look into my eyes when i say i love you
take you for a ride when i say i love you
nothing on the other side of this face
you're an oasis in this wide open space

oh i
want you to stay
don't let me go
so i say

break

our past selves died when we met
baby you and i are silhouettes
i don't think i'll ever be the same
my last words will always be your name

please don't say
we've grown apart
my love has only grown
from the start

keep this? maybe -> those were the days
always on my mind
forever and ever

oh never been
so desolate
you keep it in
side of your head
you're waiting for the
right time to say
i've been so different
it's not the same
